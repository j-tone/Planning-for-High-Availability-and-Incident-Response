| Availability | total number of successful requests / total number of requests ; this is showing how available the application is by using the amount of successful requests against the total amount of requests. The higher % of successful requests, to more available the application is. | 99%                                                                                                         |
| Latency      | histogram of requests grouped together showing the 90th percentile ; this shows requests grouped by latencies to more readily show outliers. If the 90th percentile of requests are under 100ms, then the application is shown to be responding with acceptable speed.        | 90% of requests below 100ms                                                                                 |
| Error Budget | 1 - (1-(successful requests/total number of requests) / 20%) ; this is the error budget remaining.                                                                                                                                                                            | Error budget is defined at 20%. This means that 20% of the requests can fail and still be within the budget |
| Throughput   | total number of successful requests over the course of 5 minutes ; this shows any relationship between the rate of requests coming in and potential request failures as a result.                                                                                             | 5 RPS indicates the application is functioning                                                              |
